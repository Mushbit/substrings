# substrings
üîªSecond ever Ruby project:fire:

Counts the number of appearances of words in string.

# Use cases
 - Can be used to catch overused word in your text
 - Perhaps you would like to check a text to see how often "Vin Diesel" apears in your text vs "Dwayne Johnson"

# What I learned
 - Nesting iterator methods
 - Solidifying the fundamentals of Ruby

# Acknowledgement
 - The kind people of "The Odin Project", for sacrificing their time to help out aspiring rubyists make their dreams come true ‚ù§Ô∏è
